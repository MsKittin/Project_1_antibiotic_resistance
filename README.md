# What-causes-antibiotic-resistance-
Alignment to reference, variant calling

In this project, I worked with sequencing data from a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin. Job was to analyze that sequencing data to locate the mutations responsible for giving E. coli its antibiotic resistance property. Here I research the genes that are mutated to identify the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in each case.
